# MalwareDev-Lab
A simple lab setup to get started with malware development. The lab consists of a Linux VM with Ansible and two Windows VMs (one for development and one for testing).

The lab uses Oracle VirtualBox as a virtualization platform and the combination of Ansible, Vagrant and Packer for automating the software setup and operating system installation.

For all the details on the lab and how to extend it checkout my [blog post](https://maldev.nl/posts/malware-lab])!
